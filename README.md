# Laravel-Projects

A Laravel 12 accommodation booking and messaging platform with role-based dashboards for clients, owners, and admins.

## Product Specification

### 1. System Overview

Project ImpaStay is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to manage property rentals, bookings, and user interactions through a centralized system.

The platform supports three main user roles:

- Admin (Central App)
- Unit Owners (multi-tenant accounts with subscriptions)
- Tenants (Tenant App users)

The system operates on a subscription-based model (Basic, Plus, Pro) and includes:

- Centralized administration
- Role-based access control
- Wireless system updates
- Customization capabilities

### 2. System Architecture Concept

#### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- One shared platform serves multiple Unit Owners.
- Each Unit Owner has isolated data for:
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Reports
  - Tenant communications
- Admin has full system-wide visibility.
- Tenants interact through a separate Tenant App.

#### Core Components

1. Central App (Admin System)
2. Unit Owner Accounts (Subscription-Based)
3. Tenant App
4. Support and Wireless Update System

### 5. System Workflow

#### Booking Flow

1. Tenant browses available units
2. Tenant sends booking request
3. Unit Owner reviews and manages booking
4. Booking is confirmed or declined

#### Communication Flow

- Client and owner (booking-related messages and general inbox threads on the tenant app)
- Tenant owner or **tenant admin** can start conversations from **Messages → New conversation** with:
  - Registered **clients** (guests) on that tenant
  - **Team** (other tenant admins and the business owner)
  - **ImpaStay (Central Admin)** — in-app thread via a per-tenant support proxy user; optional email alert to platform staff (see Environment)
- Central (landlord) admin and tenant users where the product exposes shared admin tools

#### Administration Flow

- Admin monitors system analytics
- Admin generates reports
- Admin manages users and subscriptions

#### Update Flow

1. System checks for updates wirelessly
2. Provider releases updates and logs
3. Admin/system applies updates
4. System configuration and customization is adjusted if needed

### 6. Key System Characteristics

- Multi-tenant architecture with shared platform and isolated user data
- Subscription-based access with features by plan
- Centralized administration across the ecosystem
- Role-based access control by user type
- Scalability for multiple Unit Owners
- Customizable settings and configurable features

## Tech Stack

- Laravel 12
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL or SQLite
- [Spatie Laravel Multitenancy](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-multitenancy) (tenant DB isolation)
- [Spatie Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) (RBAC on tenant manager flows)
- Vite + Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js
- Pest / PHPUnit for testing

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or newer
- Composer
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Database server (MySQL recommended) or SQLite

## Quick Start

### 1) Clone and install

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/lordlylexxx/Laravel-Projects.git
cd Laravel-Projects

composer install
npm install
~~~

### 2) Environment setup

~~~bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
~~~

Update your `.env` database values before migrating.

**Optional messaging / platform support**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `IMPASTAY_CENTRAL_SUPPORT_NOTIFY_EMAIL` | When set, tenant owners/admins messaging **ImpaStay (Central Admin)** also triggers a plain email to this address (requires working `MAIL_*` settings). |

Related config: `config/impastay.php`.

### 3) Migrate and seed

~~~bash
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link
~~~

On the **central (landlord)** database, `db:seed` only creates RBAC, a central admin, and sample owner/client users. It does **not** create tenant registry rows (unless you run `ExistingTenantDatabasesSeeder` separately), **accommodations**, or **bookings**—those live in **tenant** databases. With a tenant made current, run `php artisan db:seed --class=AccommodationSeeder` if you want demo listings in that tenant DB.

### 4) Run in development

Option A (single command, recommended):

~~~bash
composer run dev
~~~

Option B (separate terminals):

~~~bash
php -c scripts/php-upload-limits.ini artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
php -c scripts/php-upload-limits.ini artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8005
npm run dev
~~~

`composer run dev` and the commands above load `scripts/php-upload-limits.ini` so multi-photo accommodation uploads (up to 20 gallery images) do not hit PHP’s default 8MB `post_max_size` limit.

### 5) Multi-tenant local ports (optional)

The project supports running central and tenant app instances on different ports.

- Central app default: `127.0.0.1:8000`
- Tenant apps: `127.0.0.1:8001+` (resolved by tenant `app_port`)

If needed, run multiple `php artisan serve` processes on different ports for local tenant testing.

## Test Accounts

After seeding, you can log in with:

- Admin: admin@impasugong.gov.ph / password
- Owner: sarah.chen@email.com / password
- Client: juan.miguel@email.com / password

## Useful Commands

~~~bash
# run tests
php artisan test

# migrate database
php artisan migrate --force

# code style (if needed)
./vendor/bin/pint

# clear caches
php artisan optimize:clear
~~~

## Project Structure (High Level)

- `app/Models`: User, Tenant, Accommodation, Booking, Message, UpdateLog, Role/Permission (Spatie)
- `app/Http/Controllers`: auth, booking, messaging, dashboards, owner tenant user management
- `app/Http/Middleware`: role, tenant context, tenant manager (owner or tenant admin), client access
- `app/Services/Messaging`: e.g. central-support proxy user helper for tenant-scoped messages
- `app/Multitenancy`: tenant finder and tenant DB switching tasks
- `config/impastay.php`: ImpaStay-specific options (central support notify email)
- `database/migrations` and `database/seeders`: landlord + tenant migrations, sample data
- `resources/views`: Blade for guest/client/owner/admin; shared nav partials under `client/partials`, `owner/partials`, `admin/partials`
- `routes/web.php`: central vs tenant host groups, messages, owner routes

## Admin Tenant Management

Central admin tenant controls are available in the Tenants page:

- `GET /admin/tenants`
- `PUT /admin/tenants/{tenant}/plan`
- `PUT /admin/tenants/{tenant}/domain-status`

Changing plan updates subscription lifecycle values, and disabling a domain blocks tenant resolution in tenant routing.

## Messaging (tenant host)

Routes live in the tenant domain group in `routes/web.php` (see `messages.*` names).

| Method | Path | Who |
|--------|------|-----|
| GET | `/messages` | Authenticated users on the tenant app |
| GET | `/messages/create` | Tenant **owner** or **tenant admin** (`tenant.manager`) |
| POST | `/messages` | New thread: managers send `recipient_key` (`central` or `user:{id}`); others use legacy `receiver_id` where applicable |
| GET | `/messages/{message}` | Participant in thread |
| POST | `/messages/{message}/reply` | Participant |

The central-support **proxy** user is created in the tenant database on first use; it is excluded from **Owner → Users** management.

## Update System

Central update endpoints:

- `GET /system-updates/check`
- `GET /system-updates/download`
- `GET /system-updates/checksum`

To publish a companion SHA-256 checksum for the central package:

- `php artisan system-updates:publish-checksum`

Tenant owner/admin update page:

- `GET /owner/system-updates`
- `GET /admin/system-updates`

Persistent update logs are stored in `update_logs` (landlord connection), including check status and install acknowledgement timestamps.

## Deployment Notes

- Set APP_ENV=production and APP_DEBUG=false in .env
- Run php artisan config:cache and php artisan route:cache
- Ensure storage and bootstrap/cache are writable
- Use a process manager for queue workers if queue processing is enabled
